## `Overview`
This project is an Inventory Management System developed for the AS400 platform. The system is designed to efficiently manage inventory-related operations, providing separate dashboards for customers and vendors. The source code has been crafted using Full Free Format RPG to ensure modern and flexible programming practices.

## `Components`

## Login Page
The Login Page serves as the entry point for users, prompting them for authentication credentials. Upon successful login, users are redirected to their respective dashboards.

## Customer Dashboard
The Customer Dashboard offers a user-friendly interface for customers to interact with the inventory system. It may include features such as order history, product details, and other customer-specific functionalities.

## Vendor Dashboard1
The Vendor Dashboard provides vendors with tools to manage their inventory, update product information, and perform various vendor-specific tasks.

## Customer Dash1, Customer Dash2, Customer Dash3
These components likely represent different views or functionalities within the Customer Dashboard, allowing for a modular and organized approach to customer-related features.

## Vendor Dash2, Vendor Dash3
Similar to the customer dashboards, these components represent different views or functionalities within the Vendor Dashboard, providing a structured approach to vendor-specific tasks.

## VendSFL, VendSFLCTL
These components are associated with handling subfile (SFL) functionality, which is commonly used in AS400 programming for displaying lists of records.

## Footer
The FOOTER section likely contains shared code, functions, or constants that are common across multiple components, promoting code reusability and maintainability.

## Development Environment
The source code is written in Full Free Format RPG, emphasizing a modern and flexible programming style. This allows for improved readability, maintainability, and adherence to contemporary RPG coding standards.
